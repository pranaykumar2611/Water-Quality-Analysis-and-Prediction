# Water Quality Analysis and Prediction  
Access to safe drinking-water is essential to health, a basic human right and a component of effective policy for health protection. This is important as a health and development issue at a national, regional and local level. Therefore, modeling and predicting water quality have become very important in controlling water potability. In this work, Machine learning algorithms are developed namely decision tree algorithm for the dataset to predict the safety for human consumption. The used dataset have  significant parameters and the developed model will evaluated based on some statistical parameters. The goal of this algorithm is to create a model that predicts the value of a target variable (DecisionTreeClassifier score) whether the water is potable or not.
